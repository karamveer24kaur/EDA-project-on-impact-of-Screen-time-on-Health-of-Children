# EDA-project-on-impact-of-Screen-time-on-Health-of-Children
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis project analyzing the effect of screen time on the health of children.

# What the Project Does
- This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on children's screen time data to uncover patterns and insights. 
- It investigates how factors such as age, geographical location (urban vs rural), and device type influence daily screen time. - It also explores correlations between increased screen time and various health concerns, including anxiety, obesity risk, eye strain, and poor sleep quality.

# Why the Project is Useful
- With growing digital device use among children, this project offers valuable insights for parents, educators, and healthcare professionals. 
- It helps identify key risk areas and can inform policies or habits that encourage healthier screen time management in kids.
- The visualizations and statistical summaries make complex data easier to interpret and act upon.
